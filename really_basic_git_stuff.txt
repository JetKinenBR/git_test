Hey, this here is just a small cheatsheet for all the git commands.

    Git follows the PROGAM | ACTION | DESTINATION syntax


    Commands related to a remote repository:
        git clone git@github.com:USER-NAME/REPOSITORY-NAME.git
        git push or git push origin main (Both accomplish the same goal in this context)
    Commands related to the workflow:
        git add .
        git commit -m "A message describing what you have done to make this snapshot different"
    Commands related to checking status or log history
        git status
        git log


Two helpful best practices to consider are atomic commits and leveraging those atomic commits to make your commit messages more useful to future collaborators.
An atomic commit is a commit that includes changes related to only one feature or task of your program.
There are two main reasons for doing this: first, if something you change turns out to cause some problems, it is easy to revert the specific change without losing other changes;
and second, it enables you to write better commit messages.
